\chapter{Extension to More Complex Problems}
\section{Elasticity Equation}
Solve the Elasticity equation instead of the Poisson equation in the domain with the discontinuous Galerkin method.

\section{Three-Dimensional Simulations}
Consider a full three-dimensional domain with a two-dimensional fault instead of the cross-section infinitely long block. 


\section{Seismic Waves in the Domain}
Include seismic waves in the full domain after an earthquake. That waves could trigger an earthquake somewhere else, if there are several faults. \\
